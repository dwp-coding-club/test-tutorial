Coding (as Professional Development) Club 


We need to start looking at the application of code.

Inspired by the successful sprint, and constrained by network issues, I wanted to sprint through an initial setup of our environment for coding here.

The tools:
•	A text editor
•	A web browser 
•	A folder to keep our files.

Let’s start with a folder.

I’m going to highlight a simple method to create folders here, use whatever suits for you. Once you’ve done it, make sure a shortcut is available on your desktop.

1.	 Click the Documents icon
2.	Check you are in the Documents Library then click New Folder. Name it something meaningful, I suggest CAPclub but I’m no dictator. Then hit enter.
3.	Right click and send to desktop (Create Shortcut)
4.	Double click into it.
