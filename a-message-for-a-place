First file

Letâ€™s start with a test document 
1.	Right click inside the folder and select New > Text Document
2.	Right click the document Open With> Notepad
3.	Type 
Hello World
4.	Save as hello world.txt

I've found windows likes to presume the application you want this document opened with. We need to define the editor as the application.

Find helloWorld.txt

What does it open with?

Forcing notepad!

Right click the file and open with Notepad

Once you have it open. Save as helloWorld.html

Hopefully in your new folder we will have two documents, one .txt and one .html

If this is the case: Well done!
 ;D

Finally all we have to do is test your new html document by opening it with internet explorer.
1.	Double click the folder on your desktop
2.	Find the hello world.html file, then open with internet explorer
3.	Your file should read in the browser.

CONGRATULATIONS
